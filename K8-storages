In Kubernetes, storage solutions cater to both stateful and stateless applications. Here's an overview of the types of storage used in each context, along with information on their typical sizes:Stateless Storage SolutionsStateless applications do not require persistent storage between pod restarts. They rely on ephemeral storage options:EmptyDir:Description: A temporary storage that is created when a pod is assigned to a node and exists as long as the pod is running.Size: Limited by the node’s disk space.ConfigMap:Description: Used to inject configuration data into pods.Size: Typically small; limited by etcd (1 MB per key, 1 MB for the total size of a ConfigMap).Secret:Description: Stores sensitive information such as passwords, OAuth tokens, and SSH keys.Size: Typically small; limited by etcd (1 MB per Secret).DownwardAPI:Description: Provides a way to expose pod and container fields to a running container.Size: Small, as it generally contains metadata information.Stateful Storage SolutionsStateful applications require persistent storage that outlives the pod's lifecycle. Here are the common solutions:PersistentVolume (PV) and PersistentVolumeClaim (PVC):Description: PV is a piece of storage in the cluster that has been provisioned by an administrator or dynamically provisioned using StorageClasses. PVC is a request for storage by a user.Size: Can vary widely based on application needs; typically in the range of gigabytes (GB) to terabytes (TB).HostPath:Description: Mounts a file or directory from the host node’s filesystem into a pod. Useful for single-node testing.Size: Limited by the node’s disk space.NFS (Network File System):Description: Allows pods to use storage resources on a network-attached storage server.Size: Can vary; typically configured on the NFS server side, often in the range of GB to TB.AWS EBS (Elastic Block Store):Description: Block storage volumes for use with Amazon EC2 instances. Can be dynamically provisioned in Kubernetes.Size: From 1 GB to 16 TB per volume.GCE Persistent Disk:Description: Durable, high-performance block storage for Google Cloud Platform.Size: From 1 GB to 64 TB per disk.Azure Disk Storage:Description: Managed disks for Azure VMs. Can be dynamically provisioned in Kubernetes.Size: From 1 GB to 32 TB per disk.Ceph:Description: A distributed storage system that provides object, block, and file storage.Size: Typically configured based on the Ceph cluster; scalable from GB to PB (petabytes).GlusterFS:Description: A scalable network filesystem that allows rapid provisioning of additional storage.Size: Can scale out to several petabytes.Summary of SizesEphemeral Storage (EmptyDir, ConfigMap, Secret, DownwardAPI): Typically small to medium, limited by node’s disk space or etcd size limits (up to a few GB).Persistent Storage (PV/PVC, HostPath, NFS, AWS EBS, GCE Persistent Disk, Azure Disk, Ceph, GlusterFS): Varies widely, typically from GB to TB, and in some systems like Ceph and GlusterFS, up to PB.Each storage type has its use case, and the choice depends on the application requirements, whether it needs to retain data across pod restarts (stateful) or if it can be rebuilt without persistent data (stateless).
